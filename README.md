# Credge AI – Your Financial Coach

Credge AI is an AI-driven personal finance coach designed to empower users with intelligent, data-driven money management. It generates realistic **synthetic financial data** to protect privacy while enabling rich model training ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.15653)). It automatically **classifies and optimizes budgets**, and offers an **LLM-based investment advisor** for personalized guidance.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Synthetic Data Generator**: Uses Bayesian modeling and GANs to simulate realistic transaction records ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.15653)).
- **Budget Classification & Optimization**: Classifies expenses using deep learning (BERT, LSTM) and suggests budget improvements (~3–5% savings).
- **LLM Investment Advisor**: Provides personalized advice leveraging LLaMA/GPT-based models ([study](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chatgpt-4-vs-humans-ai-financial-analysis-forecasting-new-study-2024-5)).
- **Interactive Web App**: React-based app for goal setting, budget visualization, and investment chat.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

Credge AI has three major components:

1. **Synthetic Data Engine** (Bayesian + GANs + LLMs)
2. **Budget Classification & Optimization Agent** (Logistic Regression, LSTM, BERT, LLaMA)
3. **LLM Investment Advisor** (LLaMA, GPT, FinBERT)

These modules work together through an interactive front-end, ensuring smooth data and decision flows.

## 📈 Research Highlights

- **Synthetic Data Realism**: GAN-generated records indistinguishable from real spending patterns.
- **Classification Accuracy**: ~71% multi-class budget categorization ([WeNet-RF benchmark ~90%](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12021194/)).
- **Budget Optimization**: Users could reallocate and save 3–5% of monthly income.
- **Investment Advisor Effectiveness**: GPT-based advice aligned with human-level financial forecasting ([source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05862)).
